      - phianglements cost 0 upkeep and have 0 tax on transfer of media between units
      - phiangled units only transfer on overflow or underflow

  - Fixed the book and fixed it up a little too. Added some stuff as well.
    - Like stopping the book from not working when Hexical <2.0.0 was installed. ([#13](https://github.com/Real-Luxof/Lapisworks/issues/13))

    (Also made it cost less media)
  - Fixed the Simple Mind Container looking FUCKED
## Interop:
  - Hexal
    - Added Enchanted Slipways
      It's a Simple Mind Infusion recipe (that costs Amel as well)
      They produce twice as many wandering wisps per second but they can't be turned into portals
      with Oneironaut
    - Simple Minds, when infused into the air, produce a wandering wisp
# 1.5.8
Locked in rah
## Additions:
- Amethyst/Chalk Rituals (pre-enlightenment)  
  - same-plane-only (no wall-to-floor or wall-to-ceiling etc.)
  - 5 patterns per chalk on ground max
    - one block per three ticks
    - setting patterns requires a piece of amel  
      in-lore this is explained as the amel attracting the flow of media and fulfilling the patterns
    - clearing does not
  - plant little chunks of amethyst (like large amethyst buds but thinner)
    - tune them with Tune Media (costs amel)
    - rituals with the same frequency have ambit around that chunk of amethyst now
    - by default has 1 block of ambit, that being the tuned amethyst itself. this is the lower limit
      - Deposit Media to make the ambit larger (upper limit of 32 blocks maybe?)
      - Withdraw Media to make the ambit smaller
  - draw a BIG ASS fucking pattern on the ground
    - 9 blocks of chalk-with-pattern on the ground make a multiblock
    - media discount
    - uses your staff stack and casts as you with your ambit
    - one-time use
  - one-time rituals
    - right click with media item
    - that media item becomes the media source for that ritual
    - ritual burns chalk as it goes
    - ritual uses half your ambit and half your greater sentinel's ambit
- Enchanted Brewery
  - Imbue 10 Amel into a Brewing Stand
  - 1.5x blaze usage for 2x speed
  - Takes 1 amethyst dust per brew
- Erebus' Gambit
- Hadamard's Distillation
- Hex familiar that lets you interact with the Media Condensing Network at a range.
  - floating entity. like Terraria's flying piggy bank? or maybe just a wisp?
  - bind it to one linkable and it'll do all it's business with that one linkable
    - this linkable is it's entrypoint into any network, basically
    - can't make it auto-search for the nearest one because it needs to be not OP
  - you may now pull from that by rmb on the pet with a phial (attempts to fill whole phial)
  - you may also push to that by shift+rmb on the pet with a phial (attempts to drain whole phial)
  - costs about 2 amel per 32 blocks of distance (so free within 32 blocks)
  - i think it should be some kind of orb with a :3 face on it?
  - summon the pet via wearing a necklace for a minute
    - make it exclusive with the focus necklace :>
- Mind Control of entities in the game  
  (reality check: gang, how lost are we in the sauce?)
  - you have to un-flay with a Simple Mind first
  - you gain a "controllable" iota from the un-flaying.
    - in-lore, this is a set of mappings for what brain points do what, what makes the entity
      tick basically and also IO points for stuff (to store info for example)
    - in the event that you lose this iota, there is a pattern to get it from an entity
      that was un-flayed by you. this costs about a shard of amethyst
  - controllable movement
  - Deposit Media can be used to recharge a controllable
  - media limit of 64 dust
  - cannot overcast
  - credits to Sheppo from the Hex Casting discord server for these
    - they can be pets
    - VERY small ambit, at most 3 blocks and usually just 1 (by default too)
    - can have pre-set conditions to cast a hex, e.g. on hurt (so kind of like Hierophantics!)
      - not Sheppo: can only have one condition (in-lore: too much space occupied by condition and hex)
- Mintiest and Kitkat's Gambits (`for i in range(n):`)
- Rote Brewery
  - Infuse a Simple Mind into a Brewing Stand
  - Can remember up to 5 potion recipes
  - Each write is permanent, stops brewing anything but remembered potions when at the limit
  - When a potion from memory is selected, takes items automatically.
  - ALWAYS takes 2 steps worth of time.
    Manual brewing (or teaching it) is a pain as each step takes twice as long.
    Automated brewing (or using what's been taught) is a breeze as N steps take only 2 to do.
- Scrying patterns for blocks added by the mod.
- Scrying lens overlays
- Simple Mind Infusions now have (kind of basic) datapacking support.
## Changes:
- Book reformatting and extra documentation and shit
  - e.g. Villager un-flaying is actually documented now
- Deposit Media and Withdraw Media work conveniently now
- Enchanted Sentinels actually use your base ambit instead of a flat 32 blocks around you
- Enchanted Slipways got changed to have nearly precisely 2x slipway wisp spawn rate  
  (as i intended them to have when i first made them)
- Gold-Diamond Casting Ring has been deleted in favour of the Amel variant
- Mishap messages n shit
- You can't read an Ancient Tome before you have gotten Lapisworks Research now
## Fixes:
- Amel Jar throwing the Amel in your other hand into the void if you attempted to withdraw
  with a full stack already there
- "Bug in the mod" mishaps
- Damage and movement speed enhancements stacking on world join (you need to kys ingame to reset tho)
- Enchanted Slipways having a tendency to move 0.01f more in +XYZ than -XYZ (lmao)
- Enchantments not carrying across dimensions (:broken_heart:)
- Enchantment Purification's order of arguments being flipped
- Finally fixed that Cradle bug with items for fucking real, holy fucking shit
  (still jumpscares me. WHY)
- Logspam
- Sieve Thoughts not working on a spell circle
## Interop:
- Hierophantics
  - Max experience fishermen villagers can be flayed into you  
    costs 32 amel and 10 charged amethyst  
    they only have the on_my_reference_found trigger, triggers when your reference is found in a stack of an offender within "range"  
      stack starts with a "guess" vector pointing from you to the enemy  
    has a "vigilance" attribute which can range from 0-3  
      0: no notification  
      1: chat notification  
      2: chat + audio notification  
      3: chat + on-screen + audio notification  
    they also have a "range" attribute (0-256)  
      the higher, the more inaccurate the guess (err_margin=range/4)  
      e.g. range=64 means guess can be 16 blocks from the offender  
      or range=256 means guess can be 64 blocks from the offender  
      err range is constant across all guesses  
        so if offender is 64 blocks away but your range is 256, err can be 0-64  
      however, if the offender is in your ambit the guess is always 100% precise  
  - Less than max experience fishermen can also be flayed into you  
    costs 16 amel and 10 charged amethyst  
    they are almost equivalent to the other mind  
    err=range/8 by default, none when offender is within ambit  
    range can only be 0-96  
    starts casting with an entity reference to the offender on the stack  
    has a 1/err chance of not detecting the offender  
  - "Jack" villager type  
    - villagers turn into "Jacks" when unflayed
    "Jacks" are jacks of all trades, and start with 2-3 levels of exp on every possible profession  
    - (but no trades until they pick one of those professions)
    - they're called "Jacks" because they're jacks of all trades
  - FUCKING UNICORNS  
	  - IMBUE A SIMPLE MIND INTO A HORSE AND USE 128 AMEL
    - After being made, a Unicorn develops an affinity for you (and so is bound to you).
    - You can only have one Unicorn bound to you (any attempts to make more fail).
    - Unicorns are uncommonly seen, however they do appear around the player from time to time.  
      They VERY rarely spawn during the night.
    - Unicorns have a zone of influence around themselves with a radius of 32 blocks.
    - No hostile mobs can spawn in the presence of a unicorn, and any that spawn outside it's zone  
      of influence refuse to enter said zone of influence.
    - No patterns can execute within the zone of influence of a Unicorn, mishapping instead.
- EMI
  - You can now see Imbue Amel, Mold Amel and (most) Simple Mind Infusion recipes in EMI
  - You can also see BeegInfusion recipes in EMI
  - On that note, the same recipes also show up in Patchouli
- Hexical
  - the Cradle's item actually has a big hitbox now
  - the Media Jar and the Cradle are targets for Deposit Media, Withdraw Media and
    Condensed Media Prfn.
# 1.5.9
- Heal your mind after breaking it. (Jacked O' Lantern finale)
- Alchemy/potion-brewing overhaul (I'm deadass)  
  herb stuff that leads to discovering Alchemy?  
  cauldron brewing! (definitely probably a part of herb stuff!)
- Oneironaut interop (you will shit your pants playing Lapisworks and you will like it)  
  so you like Subnautica?  
  - added the Congested Deep Noosphere
  - diving suit required to even exist in there (added bonus of not drowning)
    - or maybe just a Hexical Gasp spell daemon?
  - note to self: might have to fuck with world build height limit for this, as some creatures are
  simply gargantuan!
  - think this should be a progression of the enchanted slipway
- Valkyrien Skies interop
  air pocket in fully closed ship protects you from congested deep noosphere effects too
- better simple mind infusion datapacking
  - entity mind infusions!
  - predicates! like how vanilla advancement predicates work
  - displays can now be textures!
- Enchanted Scroll
  - It's literally a Hex Casting IDE.  
- Enchantweave? (formerly part of Hexic interop)
- blacksmithing in hex casting (Sleepyboi's profession is far too cool not to add)
# 1.6.0
- You can have four arms now (procrastination slain)
  - Your third and fourth arms can auto-cast 20x a second  
    Both must be devoted to auto-cast, but one can hold something (e.g. Focus, Amel-tuned Orb, etc.)
  - Your third and fourth arms can hold items
  - You may swap arms 1-2 with 3-4, and use them with mouse4-5 (yes mouse4 and mouse5, rebindable)
  - They can also do macro-work for you
  - bro tip for luxof: manningham mills lets you fuck with enums
- End overhaul
  - the ender dragon bossfight is fun now (nathan adding this to his pack is a secondary motivation)
  - there are new structures
  - lore
- Entity Construction
  - make a vessel
  - flay entities into it to get their AI
  - customize it's body and mind

# 1.7.0
LAPISWORKS IS ON BOTH FORGE AND FABRIC NOW.


# hm
clairvoyance (future-seeing)  
noophaestus interop  
hexcasting media display interop  
iotic blocks interop  

addons that may have interesting interop ideas waiting to be had but idk yet:  
- hexcassettes? (`for i in range(n): enqueue(spell, tick_delay)`-like pattern?)
- hexchanting
- hexmachina
- slate works
- ephemera
- hexdeco
- heartxxy
- scryglass
  - add the ability to unfocus your mouse
  - add buttons
  - add text inputs?
- hexxyskies interop
  - ship variant of the jumpslate that jumps to the nearest ship in the specified radius
  - wisp-ify a ship by imbuing a simple mind into it
    - unlocks spells for fine-tuned ship movement?
  
much bigger phials  
~~ability to extend pattern and stack limit by expending media~~ gave that to hexthings  
  nvm hexthings threw it right back to me (infeasible for it)  
  0.01 dust per iota per pattern (meaning it stays that extended for that many patterns)
computers lmao
- slab that you can use Craft Artifact on
- you can send iotas to computers with a spell (which costs more the longer the distance)
- sending iotas chunkloads
- has ambit over itself and the adjacent blocks
- casts on block update and iota sent

KING CRIMSON (so what part, exactly, of this is Lapisworks-y?)  
(P.S. even Miyu didn't want to do this. Are we deaduzz, chat?)
- select area and time
- area continues as normal for time
- now those entities (including players) are locked in to that movement
  - to prevent others from interfering use either an invisible barrier or do the same for around that area
    (but prevent caster from going there)
- caster is not locked in to that movement  

port twokai's ideal condition  
~~port hexxy dimensions~~ pool and scepticake took it  
Ra's Gambit
- think up something motherfucker  
Gene Editing (as an extension of the 4-arm-getting system) and Entity Creation
- making yourself a vampire is possible  

Make AVM staff as a variant of sorts of Hexical's Lightning Rod Staff
- affix items to it
- enchant it to make the fixations permanent
- when enchanted, it uses the item as a power like in AVM  

enchanted amethyst
- not the first time i've thought about it, maybe see where it goes  

COOL WIZARD DRIP  

backdrawn patterns
- free exquisite idea no one's done before, like per world pattern shapes  
  probably equally painful  
  this time the pain isn't in hexdoc, but in inline etc.!  
  fun for the whole family
- fix inline
- modify pattern drawing?
- there's an UncheckedHexPattern(? not sure if that's the name) now, use it
- might need a diff pattern iota to match it to stuff in a separate registry?
  - actually maybe mixin to PatternRegistryManifest (bro getting flooded)
- inverted color in book and grid + end of drawing to represent backstroke visually
- to represent it, the letter is "s"  

zone dstl projectile  

Impulse over time spell (schedules x velocity be applied in y time on an entity z)
- lets you do curve shots  
- name "Pull", "Sustain", "Impulse: Flow", "Tween", "Drive"?  
- Pull.

JIT compilation
- not sure if i can do this or if it'd even be worth it
- it would be very funny if i did add this though lmao
- also is a novel idea no one's added yet similar to PW pattern shapes
- reduce lag on cube eval hexes for example
- basically:
  - interpret the code of the pattern list
  - turn it into effects (hard-coded)
  - if there is an unsupported pattern, fail JIT
  - if this succeeds, the code just executes a bunch of effects now with the stack like a map
  - optimize stuff
    - Explode, Fireball, Wither Nadir, Clean Effects -> Explode, Fireball, incur some media cost
    - Raycast mantra raycast block stack manip raycast architect -> raycast to block + face  

make the addon more hexxy
- "mechanics should fit into Hex Casting like legos, combinable with other stuff and robust"  
  (paraphrased from Lani)  

per world pattern shapes picking between a few handmade ones is boring..  
add some randomness!
