- Deposit Media and Withdraw Media work conveniently now

    - You can only have one Unicorn bound to you (any attempts to make more fail).
    - Unicorns are uncommonly seen, however they do appear around the player from time to time.  
      They VERY rarely spawn during the night.
    - Unicorns have a zone of influence around themselves with a radius of 32 blocks.
    - No hostile mobs can spawn in the presence of a unicorn, and any that spawn outside it's zone  
      of influence refuse to enter said zone of influence.
    - No patterns can execute within the zone of influence of a Unicorn, mishapping instead.

  - You can also see BeegInfusion recipes in EMI
- Hexical
  - the Cradle's item actually has a big hitbox now

  so you like Subnautica?  
  - added the Congested Deep Noosphere
  - diving suit required to even exist in there (added bonus of not drowning)
    - or maybe just a Hexical Gasp spell daemon?
  - note to self: might have to fuck with world build height limit for this, as some creatures are

  air pocket in fully closed ship protects you from congested deep noosphere effects too
- better simple mind infusion datapacking
  - entity mind infusions!
  - predicates! like how vanilla advancement predicates work

- Start one-time rituals with Deposit Media
- Hierophantics interop
  - new amalgamation to inject a FrameEval when your iota is used in the arguments of a pattern (and it doesn't mishap)

### And Alexander wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer.
- You can have four arms now (procrastination slain)
  - Your third and fourth arms can auto-cast 20x a second  
    Both must be devoted to auto-cast, but one can hold something (e.g. Focus, Amel-tuned Orb, etc.)
  - Your third and fourth arms can hold items
  - You may swap arms 1-2 with 3-4, and use them with mouse4-5 (yes mouse4 and mouse5, rebindable)
  - They can also do macro-work for you
  - bro tip for luxof: manningham mills lets you fuck with enums

# hm
clairvoyance (future-seeing)  
noophaestus interop  
hexcasting media display interop  
iotic blocks interop  

possible interop:  
- hexical
  - give conjured color the ability to take mage block effects
- hexcassettes? (`for i in range(n): enqueue(spell, tick_delay)`-like pattern?)
- Hexpose interop
  - spell to remove a status effect from the entity that has it
    - negative effects take power^2*time_multiplier dust to remove the status effect
    - positive effects take power^3*time_multiplier dust to remove the status effect
- hexchanting
  - modify the existing items to have spellbook-like functionality!
  - "i'm applying everything i've learned" or something
  - i'd hate to add superior stuff with amel infusion..
  - i don't want people downloading hexchanting just because of lapisworks
  - what do i do?
- complexhex
  - add qubits to hex casting (this is useless lmao)
- hexmachina
  - "i got 47 more rounds in this 6 barrel shotgun" ahh idea search
- slate works
  - make a loci that enhances cleric ambit around player to chalk circle levels!
  - costs amel
- ephemera
- hexdeco
- heartxxy
  - uhhh???
  - instant adult-ification spell, i guess?
  - like the counterpart to Hastenature, i mean
  - but Nurture exists tho...
- scryglass
  - add the ability to unfocus your mouse
  - add buttons
  - add text inputs?
- hexxyskies interop
  - ship variant of the jumpslate that jumps to the nearest ship in the specified radius
  - wisp-ify a ship by imbuing a simple mind into it
    - unlocks spells for fine-tuned ship movement?
  
much bigger phials  
~~ability to extend pattern and stack limit by expending media~~ gave that to hexthings  
  nvm hexthings threw it right back to me (infeasible for it)  
  0.01 dust per iota per pattern (meaning it stays that extended for that many patterns)  
  nvm oneironaut has it
computers lmao
- slab that you can use Craft Artifact on
- you can send iotas to computers with a spell (which costs more the longer the distance)
- sending iotas chunkloads
- has ambit over itself and the adjacent blocks
- casts on block update and iota sent

KING CRIMSON (so what part, exactly, of this is Lapisworks-y?)  
(P.S. even Miyu didn't want to do this. Are we deaduzz, chat?)
- select area and time
- area continues as normal for time
- now those entities (including players) are locked in to that movement
  - to prevent others from interfering use either an invisible barrier or do the same for around that area
    (but prevent caster from going there)
- caster is not locked in to that movement  

port twokai's ideal condition  
~~port hexxy dimensions~~ ~~pool and~~ scepticake took it  
Ra's Gambit
- think up something motherfucker
- this name is way too fucking cool not to use!  
Gene Editing (as an extension of the 4-arm-getting system) and Entity Creation
- making yourself a vampire is possible  

Make AVM staff as a variant of sorts of Hexical's Lightning Rod Staff
- affix items to it
- enchant it to make the fixations permanent
- when enchanted, it uses the item as a power like in AVM  

enchanted amethyst
- not the first time i've thought about it, maybe see where it goes  

COOL WIZARD DRIP  

backdrawn patterns
- free exquisite idea no one's done before, like per world pattern shapes  
  probably equally painful  
  this time the pain isn't in hexdoc, but in inline etc.!  
  fun for the whole family
- fix inline
- modify pattern drawing?
- there's an UncheckedHexPattern(? not sure if that's the name) now, use it
- might need a diff pattern iota to match it to stuff in a separate registry?
  - actually maybe mixin to PatternRegistryManifest (bro getting flooded)
- inverted color in book and grid + end of drawing to represent backstroke visually
- to represent it, the letter is "s"  

zone dstl projectile  

Impulse over time spell (schedules x velocity be applied in y time on an entity z)
- lets you do curve shots  
- name "Pull", "Sustain", "Impulse: Flow", "Tween", "Drive"?  
- Pull.

JIT compilation
- not sure if i can do this or if it'd even be worth it
- it would be very funny if i did add this though lmao
- also is a novel idea no one's added yet similar to PW pattern shapes
- reduce lag on cube eval hexes for example
- basically:
  - interpret the code of the pattern list
  - turn it into effects (hard-coded)
  - if there is an unsupported pattern, fail JIT
  - if this succeeds, the code just executes a bunch of effects now with the stack like a map
  - optimize stuff
    - Explode, Fireball, give effect, take away effect -> explode, fireball, incur cost
    - Raycast mantra raycast block stack manip raycast architect =
        (many) -> (many, block (from archer) + face (from architect)) =
        raycast to block + face

make the addon more hexxy
- "mechanics should fit into Hex Casting like legos, combinable with other stuff and robust"  
  (paraphrased from Lani)  

per world pattern shapes picking between a few handmade ones is boring..  
add some randomness!  

jumpslate across space and time  
-# i don't even do drugs. what does this mean, past me?  

vv only if no one else is interested  
MASSIVE wizard towers! give you ambit + cost reduction + grid size (grid size toggleable)  

trinket that casts upon dropped  
right click to prime  

trinket that stops GTP item spillage and makes it half as cheap  
- "enderman's monocle"
- rub some amethyst dust on an eye of ender, then put it in an amel-iron-diamond case  

a trinket that shows a config screen for hexes it's primed to work for! it'll show
pre-configured-for-hex iotas and let you select their values, with a default value already present  

TODO:  
- Hex familiar that lets you interact with the Media Condensing Network at a range.
  - floating entity. like Terraria's flying piggy bank? or maybe just a wisp?
  - bind it to one linkable and it'll do all it's business with that one linkable
    - this linkable is it's entrypoint into any network, basically
    - can't make it auto-search for the nearest one because it needs to be not OP
  - you may now pull from that by rmb on the pet with a phial (attempts to fill whole phial)
  - you may also push to that by shift+rmb on the pet with a phial (attempts to drain whole phial)
  - costs about 2 amel per 32 blocks of distance (so free within 32 blocks)
  - i think it should be some kind of orb with a :3 face on it?
  - summon the pet via wearing a necklace for a minute
    - make it exclusive with the focus necklace :>
- Mind Control of entities in the game  
  (reality check: gang, how lost are we in the sauce?)
  - you have to un-flay with a Simple Mind first
  - you gain a "controllable" iota from the un-flaying.
    - in-lore, this is a set of mappings for what brain points do what, what makes the entity
      tick basically and also IO points for stuff (to store info for example)
    - in the event that you lose this iota, there is a pattern to get it from an entity
      that was un-flayed by you. this costs about a shard of amethyst
  - controllable movement
  - Deposit Media can be used to recharge a controllable
  - media limit of 64 dust
  - cannot overcast
  - credits to Sheppo from the Hex Casting discord server for these
    - they can be pets
    - VERY small ambit, at most 3 blocks and usually just 1 (by default too)
    - can have pre-set conditions to cast a hex, e.g. on hurt (so kind of like Hierophantics!)
      - not Sheppo: can only have one condition (in-lore: too much space occupied by condition and hex)
- Rote Brewery
  - Infuse a Simple Mind into a Brewing Stand
  - Can remember up to 5 potion recipes
  - Each write is permanent, stops brewing anything but remembered potions when at the limit
  - When a potion from memory is selected, takes items automatically.
  - Brewing a recipe it doesn't know is a pain as each step takes twice as long.
  - Brewing a recipe it DOES know has normal speed, but reduced ingredient cost.
    - cost reduction = 20% chance not to consume the ingredient being used  

potions!
  - potions of shine and dim
    - enable and disable the enchanted texture effect via pouring over an item
    - "pouring" is a shapeless crafting recipe with the item and the potion
  - chorus fruit potion
    - causes teleportation all over the place?
  - ender pearl potion
    - teleports you to where you consumed it after the effect runs out
    - milk bypasses teleportation
    - you can just. keep. adding redstone to make it longer
    - gives you Chaos when it teleports you, paralyzing you for a few seconds (like Terraria)  

so you know about the Ultra Instinct beam effect when Goku first achieves it right  
do that but for the chalk multiblock  
invert the color of the world inside the beam  
make it spin  
make it rectangular like a beacon's  
make it play a cool ass sound effect  
all that jazz  

probably a library mod:  
- Patchouli variables. You can embed them into text. They sync across client and server automatically.
- Works with hexdoc.
