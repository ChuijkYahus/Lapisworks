The cool idea for Hex Casting was fun to bring into reality.  

### FOR CODE READERS:  
- "What's the VAULT?"  
    I use it to fetch, drain and give items. You don't need to use it at all.  
    Prime example of usage in BeegInfusions.
- "What's `Flags.java`?"  
    Part of the VAULT. It's used to filter where to search for items. Just trust that the formulae'll work lmao.  
    Prime example of usage in BeegInfusions.
- "What's the `InventoryItem.java` interface?"  
    *Also* part of the VAULT. Implement it and the VAULT will be able to interact with items in your `InventoryItem`'s inventory.
- "What's a BeegInfusion"?  
    NBT-dependent or otherwise dynamic Amel imbuement of items.  
    Prime example in `EnhanceEnchantedBook.java`.
- "What's an SMindInfusion"?
    For now, any recipe that the pattern Imbue Mind uses or can use.  
    Prime examples in `MakeBuddingAmethyst.java` and `UnflayVillager.java`.
