Because I had a sick idea to expand Hex Casting and it really stuck and it was actually fun to do.  
Only Fabric 1.20.1 bcause I believe in Fabric supremacy RAHHHH (I can't be bothered to learn Architectury)
I MIGHT make an Architectury addon sometime in the future (it's 3/8/2025 as of writing this) 'cause the Hex Casting Forge addons scene is literally a desert and I pity Mekanism fans. (also other Forge mod fans too I guess but Mekanism is a cool mod, it's a shame it's only on Forge.)  

Would I recommend this addon as a template for Hex Casting addons? No.  
Would I recommend it for *reading* to make Hex Casting addons? Sure, whatever.
